    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are crucial for handling large datasets and ensuring optimal performance.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of the length of the input. It is often denoted as O(n), where n represents the size of the input.</p>
