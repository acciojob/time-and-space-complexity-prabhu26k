    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is an important concept in computer science to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms. A lower time complexity generally means a more efficient algorithm.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It helps in understanding how much storage is needed for an algorithm to run. For example, an algorithm that uses additional arrays or lists may have a space complexity of O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input.</p>
